# Parallel_Computing_Circles_Painting_Java

## Abstract 
This project is focused on analyzing the increase of performance that can be obtained through the introduction of **Parallel Programming** both in c ++ and Java languages.  
The problem consisted on rendering a high number of figures in space and test the variation of performance between the sequential version of the programm and varius parallel version. Check the document *paralle_relazione_cerchi.pdf* for the problem formulation, the chosen solution and more the implementation details.
